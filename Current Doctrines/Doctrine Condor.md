# Doctrine Condor
#### Overview
###### Condors - “The New Atron”. Act as fast tackle, but are also able to apply dps at range. Fly similar to crows. Can point at range and bombard with missiles while keeping transversal up. These should be used in many respects in similar situations as the Atron is currently being used.  But they can also be used in conjunction with merlins, bursts, griffins, and maulus as a full fleet comp.
