#### A Repo for AIEU &amp; Brave Co Fits

For easy import to EFT or pyft, download the zip.  The .xml files have all of the fits associated with that doctrine.  If you are looking to add only certain ship types you can find them by browsing the doctrines folders or finding them under the [Individual Fits](https://github.com/stevensT/AIEU-BRAVE_Fits/tree/master/Individual%20Fits) folder.

Please leave a comment if you have any questions or feedback.

Thanks
