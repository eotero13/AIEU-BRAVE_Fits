For easy import to EFT or pyft, download the doctrines above that you want.  The .xml files have all of the fits associated with that doctrine.  If you are looking to add only certain ship types you can find them by browsing the doctrines folders or finding them under the [Individual Fits](https://github.com/stevensT/AIEU-BRAVE_Fits/tree/master/Individual%20Fits) folder.

Please leave a comment, in the Issues section, if you have any questions or feedback or get with me on Slack.

Thanks
