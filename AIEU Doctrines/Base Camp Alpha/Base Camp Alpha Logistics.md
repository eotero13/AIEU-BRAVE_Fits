# Base Camp Alpha Logistics
#### Overview
###### Logistics ships are the space priests. They never show up on kill mail as anything but a victim, but they can turn the tide of battle significantly. As a space priest, you will be in the back field keeping the main combat ship's shields up while they are under fire.
