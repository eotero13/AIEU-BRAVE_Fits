# Base Camp Alpha EWAR
#### Overview
###### Unless your enemy is lobbing bombs, he can't shoot what he can't target. The EWAR jammer is a role that generates more frustration and cursing in the enemy than any other role. EWAR's role is to hang back with Logistics and simply target and engage your ECM module on as many enemies as you can, making them so that they can't target your friends to shoot them.

Notes:
Long awaited, the AIEU Free Vigil is not properly part of the skill plan, but can be picked up with only a minor detour, and is BRAVE doctrine compliant.
