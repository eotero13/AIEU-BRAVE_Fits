# Base Camp Alpha Cavalry
#### Overview
###### Cavalry's role in the fleet is that of a main combat ship. Think of them as light cavalry, a bit more armor and damage potential but still pretty fast. They start putting real damage on the target and get secondary tackle, that is get more Warp Disruptors on the target so that even if we lose some of the Tacklers the target still dose not get away.
