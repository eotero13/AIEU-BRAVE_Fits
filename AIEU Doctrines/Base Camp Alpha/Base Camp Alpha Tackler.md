# Base Camp Alpha Tackler
#### Overview
###### Fast tackle ships are usually used as scouts in a fleet, jumping "+1" (one system ahead of the fleet) and reporting on what enemy activity can be seen in that system. The tackler's bigger role in a fleet is to burn toward the enemy and tackle them, that is to remove their ability to warp away before the rest of the fleet is able to move in.
