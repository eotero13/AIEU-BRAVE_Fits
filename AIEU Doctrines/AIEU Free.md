# AIEU Free Fits
#### Overview
###### The AIEU Free program is intended to provide cheap, basic PvP and PvE ships to members of Alea Iacta Est Universal haven't yet trained for more advanced ships that require higher skills, or for people who can't yet afford ships (or who are like most of the directorate and just can't afford ships period). This is a corporate-run service run by the AIEU directorate to help get AIEU pilots into the game as soon as possible and having a good time.
