# Base Camp Bravo Cavalry
#### Overview
###### Bravo Cavalry's role is that of heavier Cavalry, they tend to have more of a tank and be a bit slower but put out more damage than Alpha Cavalry. This is a smaller group of ships but each one has it's place and should be welcome on most fleets. Note that the close range ships all have warp disruptors or warp scramblers equipped. This is because they are also expected to hold point (warp scrambler/disruptor) On the enemy that they are shooting at.
